# mushroom-species-classification-by-image-pytorch
The project is presented in the exposition notebook
the purpose of this project is for me to learn about deep learning with 
PyTorch, using the fastai front end. 

Keywords: neural nets, deep learning, pytorch, fastai, transfer learning, 
fine tuning, one cycle learning, boot strapping, fine grain classification. 

Introduction: 

Being able to tell one mushroom species from another can mean the difference 
between picking yourself a tasty meal or ending up with something that could 
make you sick or even lead to death. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms 
have been cataloged worldwide and creating a classifier that has been trained 
on all of these species presents a data collection challenge that I was not 
prepared to undertake. In this project, I wanted to perform the data collection 
and data cleaning steps myself, to keep things manageable I decided to work 
toward creating a classifier that will be useful to people foraging in a more 
localized geographical area. I learned that mushroom foraging is a popular 
activity in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Being a Canadian myself, 
this is the geographical region I decided to focus my efforts on.

The rest of the details can be found in the exposition notebook for this project.
