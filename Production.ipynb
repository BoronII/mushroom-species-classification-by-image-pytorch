    "Being able to tell one mushroom species from another can mean the difference between picking yourself a tasty meal or ending up with something that could make you sick or even lead to death. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms have been cataloged world wide and creating a classifier that has been trained on all of these species presents a data collection challenge that I was not prepared to undertake. In this project I wanted to perform the data collection and data cleaning steps myself, to keep things managable I decided to work toward creating a classifier that will be useful to people foraging in a more localized geographical area. I learned that mushroom foraging is a popular activity in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Being a canadian myseld, this is the geographical region I decided to focus my efforts on.\n",

    "Many mushroom species (particularly those in the same family) are  similar in apearance. Musroom guides such as the one created by researchers from the University of Aarhus and University of Copenhagen([MycoKey](http://www.mycokey.com/)), typically incorparate a number of factors beyond appearance when trying to make a positive identification. These factors include location, season, and growing conditions."
